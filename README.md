## London Bicycle
One fo the public datasets on BigQuery is the London Bicycle data. The bikesharing platform in London publishes their information on the BigQuery platform. Some of the information found can be:

- Bike stations capacity
- Ride IDs
- Bike IDs
- Length of rides
- Popular stations

Many more interesting analyses can be done by writing some queries on the platform and then using Data Studio to visualize.

## Questions answered on the dashboard
You can find the dashboard here [London Cycle Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/s/uw5sAWBUrzk). The questions answered were:
- How many stations are at capacity, empty, or out of service?
- What is the most popular station to start rides for all time?
- What is the most popular station to end rides for all time?
- What are the top 3 most popular trips (start and end station combination) for all time?
- Which hours of the day does usage peak on weekdays?
- Which hours of day does usage peak on weekends?
